# ROMpEIT

#### Welcome to the ROMpEIT Toolbox

The framework for Reduced Order Modelling for parametric Electrical Impedance Tomography.

Copyright 2024, Matthew R. Walker and Leandro Beltrachini

## Description

This git repo contains the toolbox for the ROMpEIT framework. Reduced Order Modelling is a numerical technique for
the rapid calculation of paramterised boundary value problems. Parametric Electrical Impedance Tomography is
a technique to estimate the conductivites of the tissues in the head, containing within it many boundary value
problems to solve. This toolbox marries the two techniques for rapid solutions to the pEIT problem.

## Installation

Firstly, download this git repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/09nwalkerm/ROMpEIT.git
```

#### BLEIGIFP installation

It is highly recommended that you install the BLEIGIFP matlab code for solving generalised eigenvalue problems.
The code can be downloaded [here](https://www.ms.uky.edu/~qye/bleigifp.html).
Make sure to add this function to your MATLAB path.

## Documentation

The documentation for each function and class in this toolbox can be found [here](https://rompeit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
