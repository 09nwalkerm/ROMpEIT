# ROMpEIT

#### Welcome to the ROMpEIT Toolbox

The framework for Reduced Order Modelling for parametric Electrical Impedance Tomography.

Copyright 2024, Matthew R. Walker and Leandro Beltrachini

## Description

This git repo contains the toolbox for the ROMpEIT framework. Reduced Order Modelling is a numerical technique for
the rapid calculation of paramterised boundary value problems. Parametric Electrical Impedance Tomography is
a technique to estimate the conductivites of the tissues in the head, containing within it many boundary value
problems to solve. This toolbox marries the two techniques for rapid solutions to the pEIT problem.

To use this work please cite as appropriate (citation to be updated soon)

## Installation

Firstly, download this git repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/09nwalkerm/ROMpEIT.git
```

Next, make a directory in which you would like to keep the results generated by the toolbox. Then navigate to
the setup/ directoy in ROMpEIT and source the set_env.sh script to set some environment variables.
When prompted, add the path to the results folder you made. Then type "y" when asked to create a log folder.

```sh
mkdir ROMpEIT_results
cd ROMpEIT/setup/
. set_env.sh
```

You're now ready to start matlab and use the toolbox or submit SLURM jobs. Please see the example.m script
for an idea of the general workflow.

#### BLEIGIFP installation

It is highly recommended that you install the BLEIGIFP matlab code for solving generalised eigenvalue problems.
The code can be downloaded [here](https://www.ms.uky.edu/~qye/bleigifp.html).
Make sure to add this function to your MATLAB path.

## Documentation

The documentation for each function and class in this toolbox can be found [here](https://rompeit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Getting Started

Please see the example.m script in the scripts/ folder. More soon.
